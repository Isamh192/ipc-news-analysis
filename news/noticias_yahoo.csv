Brazil's real appreciated 0.2% against the dollar, as iron ore prices, one of the country's top exports, gained on news of authorities in top consumer China considering government purchases of unsold homes. Separately, data showed inflation in Brazil as measured by the IGP-10 price index rose 1.08% in May, compared to a 0.33% drop in April. Mexico's peso dipped 0.1% against the dollar as the greenback regained strength, though hovering near its highest level in over a month. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of global peers recouped some losses to rise 0.3% after Wednesday's fall when data had showed U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April, which boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve could kickstart its policy easing cycle as early as September. ""Wednesday's US CPI report was notable because it seemed to mark an end to the stream of top-side surprises that began in January,"" Macquarie strategists noted. ""The bad news, though, is that one month of at-consensus core CPI may not be ""enough"" to start the Fed's countdown on a rate cut."" Colombia's peso shed 0.2%, while Peru's sol was last down 0.6%. Chile's peso staved off steep losses to rise 0.3%, touching its highest level in over four months, its fourth successive day of gains. As of 10:40 a.m. ET (1440 GMT), MSCI's index for Latin American stocks shed 0.1%, while a gauge for currencies edged 0.1% higher. Heavyweight Brazil's Bovespa stock index was flat, as gains in consumer staples and health care stocks were countered by falling energy shares. Equities in Mexico slipped 0.2%, while those in Argentina fell 0.5% after logging sharp gains in the last two sessions. Argentina will post a budget surplus in April for the fourth consecutive month under the new government, the country's economy chief said late on Wednesday, touting the trend as a reflection of stronger finances in the midst of an economic slump.

MSCI's index for Latin American currencies rose 0.3% against the dollar which dropped to month-ago levels after data showed April U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected, reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. The Mexican peso appreciated 1% to a month's high as higher crude prices supported the oil exporting country's currency. Copper producer Chile's peso strengthened 1% to over a three-month high as the red metal's value rose. Fellow copper producer Peru's sol inched up 0.1%. Data showed the Andean economy contracted 0.28% in March from a year earlier, reversing two straight months of growth. Colombia's peso ticked up 0.5% to over a month's high. The oil producer's economy grew 0.7% year-on-year in the first quarter, meeting market expectations. ""Domestic demand was the main source of the low growth. The performance of fixed investment and the manufacturing industry remains concerning,"" said Mauricio Hernández, senior economist of BBVA Research in Colombia. Among laggards was Brazil's real. The region's largest economy contracted more than expected in March but clinched a positive performance in the first quarter, central bank data showed. MSCI's gauge for Latin American equities crept up 0.1%, limited by heavyweight Brazil's main index which dropped to lows of more than a week ago. Petrobras slid over 5% to a month's low and was the biggest drag on the Bovespa after the state-run oil firm said its chief executive would be replaced by a former regulator with views closer to those of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The firm also posted downbeat first-quarter earnings. ""Lula has been vocal in his calls for Petrobras to be run for the benefit of Brazil as opposed to shareholders. We wouldn't be surprised if he turns these calls into greater pressure and, ultimately, action,"" Allen Good, director of Morningstar, wrote. Among others, JBS jumped 7.8% to a 20-month high after the world's largest meatpacker reported strong first-quarter results despite headwinds faced by its large U.S. beef business. Argentina's main stock index rose over 4% to a one-week high, a day after its central bank cut the benchmark interest rate to 40% after inflation slowed for the fourth straight month.

The Mexican peso appreciated 0.7% as the greenback lost strength after data showed U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April, suggesting that inflation resumed its downward trend at the start of the second quarter in a boost to financial market expectations for a September interest rate cut by the Fed. ""This morning's in-line CPI print should assuage near-term fears that inflation has been re-accelerating after string of hotter prints in the first quarter,"" said Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments. ""While the Fed will want to see further data showing that inflation has resumed its drift lower before gaining confidence that they can lower interest rates, today's print should begin to shift the narrative back towards ""when"" the Fed will cut in 2024 rather than ""if"" they will cut.""

As of 1931 GMT MSCI's index for Latin American currencies was flat as investors were in a wait and see mode in the lead up to the U.S. consumer inflation print which could dictate the Federal Reserve's monetary policy trajectory and that of the greenback. Still, Colombia's peso strengthened 1.2% to over a month's high. A Reuters poll showed economic growth in the region's fourth largest economy was seen at 0.7% in the first quarter, from a year earlier, with domestic consumption moderating and inflation and interest rates still high. Chile's peso rose 0.7% to over a three month high. The copper producer's government raised its annual economic growth forecast, and also lifted its full-year inflation forecast to 3.8%, from 3.1% previously. Also aiding Chilean peso's rise was U.S. copper futures, which stormed to a record high. Brazil's real climbed 0.4% after minutes from the local central bank's last policy meeting showed the members who voted for a larger interest rate cut last week remained committed to pursuing the inflation target and the necessary terminal interest rate to achieve this convergence. The decision to slow down the pace of rate cuts had sent the real lower by over 1% on concerns of upcoming decisions being influenced by politics. The real is up 1.2% month-to-date but is still underperforming peers. ""All members appeared to be in agreement that the economy and labor market are faring better than previously expected and that the government's changes to the fiscal framework were a cause for concern,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. Separately, Brazil's Treasury has confronted waning demand for its inflation-linked bonds despite offering higher rates amid global and domestic uncertainties, hampering efforts to lengthen the maturity of the country's debt. On the equities front, MSCI's gauge for Latam stocks was muted, while Argentina's MerVal index rose 1.8% after data showed consumer prices in the embattled economy rose less-than-expected in April. Regional heavyweight Brazil's main stock index added 0.3%, though gains were limited by Petrobras' 1.5% drop after the energy giant posted worse-than-expected results for the first quarter, hurt by less profitable fuel sales. Hapvida jumped over 10% after the Brazilian healthcare operator posted a higher first-quarter adjusted net profit, while Natura &Co shed over 8% after the cosmetics maker reported a wider quarterly net loss.

Regional heavyweight Brazil's main stock index gained 0.3% early on, boosted by advancing health care and information technology shares. Hapvida jumped over 8% after the Brazilian healthcare operator posted a first-quarter adjusted net profit of 506.8 million reais ($98.3 million), up from 33.1 million reais a year earlier. Natura &Co shed over 4% after the cosmetics maker reported a net loss of 934.9 million reais ($181.29 million) for the first quarter, larger than the 652 million-real loss it had posted a year earlier. Shares in Mexico dipped 0.4%, while those in Peru and Argentina gained 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively. In the lead up to a crucial U.S. inflation print on Wednesday which could dictate the Fed's rate trajectory, fresh data showed U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in April, indicating that inflation remained stubbornly high early in the second quarter. Also on the radar would be data out of Argentina which is expected to showed the country's monthly inflation rate likely dipped back into single digits for the first time in half a year in April, analysts polled by Reuters estimated, amid a gradual slowdown in price rises as the country's economy stalls.

As of 1927 GMT on Monday, MSCI's index for Latin American currencies was down 0.1% against the dollar, while a gauge for stocks was up 0.1%. Top on investors' watchlist is U.S. consumer and producers prices data for the month of April, due during the week, which could offer insights into when the Federal Reserve could kickstart its monetary policy easing cycle and thereby the trajectory of the dollar. Brazil's real inched up 0.1% following last week's 1.7% drop after the iron ore exporter's central bank slowed the pace of rate cuts. On Tuesday markets will parse through minutes of the Copom's meeting. Mexico's peso was flat. Governor Victoria Rodriguez said Banxico will discuss the possibility of resuming interest rate cuts at the upcoming June meeting, adding that it could cut rates even if the Fed decides to keep its rates steady at its next scheduled meeting. ""We wouldn't be surprised if Mexico will wait a little longer or slows down just to catch up with the Fed,"" Eduardo Ordonez Bueso, EM debt portfolio manager at BankInvest said. ""The sentiment so far, not only in Mexico but across borders is that, there might be a delay in cuts because they (central banks) really want to wait for the Fed to act."" Copper producer Chile's peso outperformed peers, climbing 0.4% as prices of the red metal surged, while trading of Colombia's peso was thinned as local markets were shut on account of a public holiday. Most currencies in the region have depreciated, while most local equity indexes are in gains year-to-date, as domestic central banks kicked off their respective policy easing cycles earlier in the year. Among individual bourses, Brazil's Bovespa added 0.4%, underpinned by gains in financials stocks. Banco BTG Pactual added 1.8% after Latin America's biggest investment bank, reported record adjusted net income and revenue for the first quarter. Azul gained around 2.3% after the Brazilian airline said its losses narrowed in the first quarter to 324.2 million reais ($62.86 million). Argentina's MerVal index slid 2.5% to a weeks low, ahead of data on Tuesday where analysts polled by Reuters expect inflation to likely dip back into single digits for the first time in half a year in April, Elsewhere, staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Argentine authorities reached agreement on the eighth review of the country's $44 billion extended fund facility arrangement.
